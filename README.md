# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
* AutosRUs is suffering from production delays on their newest prototype, the MechaCar. Upper management is requesting a review of the production data for insights that may alleviate the delays. Specifically, they would like to predict the miles per gallon (mpg) of prototypes, pounds per square inch (psi) of suspension coils from differing manufacturer lots, determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population, and they would like a study to compare the MechaCar's performance against other manufacturers' vehicles.
